# Employmee Management App :tomato:


* This application to generate values for employees from a database seamlessly and randomly, add said employee's details to a database (SQLite for Android) and display said employees in a table with the option to search, sort or edit details. 
* Its an Android port of my JavaFX application. 
* You can find the Desktop application here - https://github.com/SrivastavaSrijan/employee-management-app-desktop
* This Android app was developed using Material Design and Android Jetpack by implementing the latest design guidelines such as RecylerView, SearchView and CardView.
* For streamlining design, I used Circular Progress Buttons to intimate statuses to the user and define a  Call to Action.
* It uses JavaFaker internally and stores the data using Android Room built on top of SQLite.
* I used a simple CustomFilter for searching for employees. The contents were populated using RecylerView. Android CardView was used for the dashboard design on the home page. 
* It was then simulated and debugged on GenyMotion.
